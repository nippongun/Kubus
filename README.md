# Kubus

This is a project of the summer of 2020. In this project I try to further my experience with the Unity engine. 

Concept: A city building game with building blocks, which allows the player to build upwards in a third dimension. 
The height is utilized to build high-rise buildings, where the level of each cell/block is crucial for the development.

#Implemented features:
-Placing blocks.
-Dictionary for the individual blocks.
-Road placing system.
-RTS-like controller. Inspiration from Cities: Skylines.
